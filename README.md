# SDL2 Language Benchmark
I thought it would be fun to benchmark SDL2 in different system programming languages.

## SDL2 Benchmark
| Lanuage     | Memory Usage | Executable Size |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| C           | 12.6 MB      | 17.1 K          |
| Rust        | 10.1 MB      | 327 K           |
| Zig         | 9.5 MB       | 78 K            |

### Results
| Lanuage     | Score  |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Zig         | 1 pt   |
| C           | 0 pt   |
| Rust        | -1 pt  |

#### Wins
- **C program** has the **smallest executable size**.
- **Zig program** has the **lowest memory usage**.

#### Loses
- **Rust program** has the **largest executable size**.
- **C program** has the **highest memory usage**
